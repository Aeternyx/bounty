- [ ] fix anal bonerses
- [ ] implement `room_goto`, `room_goto_next`, `room_goto_previous` and `draw_sprite` and `draw_sprite_ext`? and `draw_text`
- [ ] remember to `.create()` all prototypes. can do this via sed, or in the engine. we'll see
- [ ] `all` is all active instances in a room
- [ ] trigger alarms. maintain a tick count and trigger alarms that are divisible
- [ ] fix half elf shit (skipping room dont work 100%)
- [ ] make correct stats display instantly. copying the stats over will work
- [ ] clear class instances i guess. not hard, just `instance_destroy` on room close
- [ ] stat text is not reset to white for some reason. weird
- [ ] sort out instance_destroy and using the prototype and when to create new shit
- [ ] call .destroy on objects
- [ ] non prototype `.instances` should only return itself
- [ ] reset obj_stats on game restart
